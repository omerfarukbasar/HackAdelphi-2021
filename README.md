# HackAdelphi-2021
This contains my chosen project for the Adelphi Hackathon.

This project is essentially a text encrypter and decrypter program
that is joined together by a GUI implementation.

I utilize a GUI program/module called PySimpleGUI to create a GUI for my program.
The open source project for PySimpleGUI can be found with the following link.
https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The encryption and decryption protocols were written entirely by myself.

The GUI implementation required me to reference some demo programs
created by PySimpleGUI which can be found from the following link.
